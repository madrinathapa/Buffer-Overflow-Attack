'mprotect' protects(sets permissions) the memory pages in within the interval of the parameters provided to it.
If any of the permission that is set is violated then it generates a SIGSEGV signal for the process.


1. In the first way, the code was compiled with the 'mprotect' and it worked fine because 
the 'PROC_EXEC' permission was set. 

2. In the second way, the code was compiled without 'mprotect' thus no 'PROC_EXEC' was
not set and when the code tried to execute the memory region it failed as the permission was violated.
